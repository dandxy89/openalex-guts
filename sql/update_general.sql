--- what to update

-- create updated_date in all mid tables that I expect it for in the export
-- set updated_date when I do anything :)


-- rename my normalized_name stuff to match_name, to keep mag's distinct
-- code up a function to write the normalized_name that mag needs, for like affilation/institution

-- crossref and pubmed already done, wrt pulling in orcids.
-- No need to update old things in the future; will be triggered by new records.
